# Loading MIMIC III into a SQL Server database

The MIMIC III website contains a tutorial that explains how to load the data into a PostgreSQL database:  https://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install-mimic-locally-ubuntu/


I'm a SQL Server guy, so I decided to load MIMIC III into that system.  This folder contains all the script I used.
